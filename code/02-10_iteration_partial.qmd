# Learning objectives  
Today's learning objectives are to:   

  - Understand the need for iteration and automation  
  - Explore three different approaches to iteration and automation:  
    - function writing  
    - loops  
    - list mapping  

# Introduction  
This exercise is adapted from the analysis performed in the paper **Santos, Bastos, et al. (2022). Identifying Nematode Damage on Soybean through Remote Sensing and Machine Learning Techniques**, https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/10/2404.

This study evaluated the potential to predict different **nematode counts** using **drone-based remote sensing metrics** in soybeans.  

A total of **43 georeferenced soil and plant samples** were collected from a field grown with **soybeans** and known to be previously infested with different nematode species.
![](../data/site.png)

Soil and soybeans root material from each sampling point were analyzed in a laboratory for different nematode species, including:  
  - Meloidogyne incognita (mel)  
  - Pratylenchus brachyurus (pb)  
  - Heterodera glycines (het)  
  
On the same day that the soil and plant samples were collected, a drone-mounted multispectral sensor was also flown over the field. 

Imagery data was extracted from each point where soil and plant samples were taken. Imagery data included reflectance in the bands of   
  - red (r),  
  - green (g),  
  - blue (b),  
  - near-infrared (nir),  
  - red-edge (re)  

# Tasks  
Our goal with this data is to:  
  - Calculate different vegetation indices using the bands  
  - For each of the nematode variables, run all possible combinations of bivariate regression models, with each band and vegetation index as the single explanatory variable.  
  
For ex:  

  number of Meloidogyne incognita nematode in the roots ~ reflectance on the green band  
  
We have a total of:  
  - **response variable**: 10 nematode-related variables  
  - **explanatory variables**: 5 bands + 10 vegetation indices  
  - **total models**: 10 x 15 = 150 models

# 1) Setup  

Here is where we load the packages we will use.

```{r setup, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
#| message: false
#| warning: false


# Loading packages
library(tidyverse) # for data wrangling and plotting
library(janitor) # clean column names
library(knitr) # for figure displaying
```

Reading data.  
```{r}
#| message: false

nematode <- read.csv("../data/03_nematode_rs.csv")

nematode
```
  
# 2) EDA  
```{r summary}
summary(nematode)
```

```{r density plot} 
nematode %>%
    # plotting everything at the same time
  pivot_longer(cols = mel_s:re) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) + 
  geom_density() + # outline of the histograms
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free")


```

# 3) Function writing - ndvi 
The first step will be to calculate 10 different vegetation indices.  

Vegetation indices represent different ways of combining reflectance data from different bands. One of the main formats of vegetation indices is the **normalized difference vegetation index**, that takes the form of:  

$$ ndvi = \dfrac{(nir - vis)}{(nir + vis)}$$
where **nir** is reflectance from the near-infrared band, and **vis** is reflectance from any band from the visible region (blue, red, green, red-edge).  

One example of creating ndvi for the nir and red bands would be:  

```{r}
nematode %>%
  mutate(rndvi = (nir - r)/(nir + r))
```

Since we're going to calculate this for each of the visible-region bands (5 in total), **let's write a function so we avoid some code repetition**.  

```{r ndvi function}
ndvi <- function(nir,vis) {
  (nir - vis)/(nir + vis)
}

```

The **function name** is `ndvi`. 
It takes 2 **arguments**:  
  - nir: a vector with data on the near-infrared reflectance  
  - vis: a vector with data on one of the visible bands reflectance

The function **returns** a vector with the result of the ndvi calculation using the specific nir and visibile band information provided.  

Let's see how that would compare to the previous step:  

```{r}
nematode %>%
  mutate(rndvi = ndvi(nir, r))

```

Now that we created a function to help with one type of vegetation index, let's go ahead and compute all 10 different ones.  

```{r}
nematode_w <- nematode %>%
  # Calculating ndvi-based indices
  mutate(rndvi = ndvi(nir,r),
         gndvi = ndvi(nir, g),
         bndvi = ndvi(nir, b),
         rendvi = ndvi(nir,re)
                 ) %>%

  # Calculating other non-ndvi-based indices
  # For reference, see paper.
  mutate(sr = nir/r,
         rdvi = ((nir-r)/(nir+r))^2,
         savi = (((1+0.5)*(nir-r))/(nir+r+0.16)),
         vari = (g-r)/(g+r-b),
         evi = 2.5*(nir-r)/(nir+(6*r)-(7.5*b))+1,
         nli=  ((nir^2)-r)/((nir^2)+r))

nematode_w 
```

# 4) Function writing - CV
Now, let's say we wanted to write a function to obtain some statistical summary metrics for each of the new variables we calculated.  

Let's write a function to return to us the mean and coefficient of variation. If you recall, there is no function for CV in R, so let's also create that.  

First, a function for CV.  
```{r}
meancv <- function(x) {
  # Calculate intermediary steps of mean and sd
  mean <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  sd <- sd(x, na.rm = TRUE) #na.rm type of behavior
  # Calculate cv
  cv <- (sd/mean)*100
  # Combine them into a data frame
  df <- data.frame(mean = mean,
                   cv = cv
                   ) # first mean column name then the objective
          
  # Return the data frame
  return(df)  
}  


meancv
```

Let's apply it to one of the vegetation indices  
```{r}
meancv(nematode_w$rndvi)
```

# 5) Loops  
Different types of loops exist, with `for` and `while` loops being the most popular.  

A `for` loop iterates through positions in a vector and apply the same task to each position, returning a result for each of them.  

Now, let's say I wanted to calculate the mean and CV for each of the response and explanatory variable columns in our data set.  

Since we will be performing the same task across many columns, we could create a loop where, for each column,   
  - we apply the function `meancv`, 
  - the function returns back the mean and CV,
  - the loop appends all the results together  
  
Loops are very useful when **repeating the same task across different scenarios**.  

In this case, the **task being repeated is to calculate mean and CV**, and the **different scenarios are the columns**.  

```{r}
nematode_w 
```

Let's create a for loop to do that for us.  
First, let's create an empty data frame scaffold to be populated by the results of the loop.  

```{r}
nematode_meancv <- data.frame(variable = rep(NA, 26), #preparing to filling up, just the frame
                              mean = rep(NA, 26),
                              cv = rep(NA, 26)
                              )

nematode_meancv
```

Each row above will be populated with the name of the variable, its mean and cv.  

```{r}
for (i in 3:ncol(nematode_w)) {
  # Getting the name of all columns
  colnames <- colnames(nematode_w)
  # Defining the name of the variable being analyzed in a given loop step
  varname <- colnames[i]
  
  # Calculating mean and cv
  statsum <- meancv(nematode_w[[i]])
  # Appending results to the empty data frame  
  nematode_meancv$variable[[i-2]] <- varname
  nematode_meancv$mean[[i-2]] <- statsum$mean
  nematode_meancv$cv[[i-2]] <- statsum$cv
  # Print a message
  print(paste("Finished with variable",varname))
}
```

Let's inspect `nematode_meancv`  
```{r}
nematode_meancv
```

# 6) List mapping  
Another way of doing iteration is through mapping a function to different components of a list.  

We can do that with the package `purrr` and some of its functions:  
  - `map(x)` functions take one iterating element, x  
  - `map2(x, y)` functions take two iterating elements, x and y  
  - `pmap(x, y, ..., n)` functions take n iterating elements  

One way of working with these functions is with the combo `group_by() + nest()` to create the iterating data frames, followed by `mutate()` and `map()` to apply a given function to each iterating piece.  

Let's see that in practice.  

The goal of the next chunk is to run linear models of the type `y ~ x`, where y is one of the response variables (we have a total of 10) and x is one of the explanatory variables (we have a total of 15).  

In the end, we will have **150 models**, and I would like to keep only the one with the greatest R2 for each response variable.  

This approach creates a bit of a brain-twist, since we are creating data sets (and other object types) inside of the initial data set.  


```{r}
nematode_mods <- nematode_w %>%
  # Pivotting longer for the response variables
  pivot_longer(cols = mel_s:eggs_r,
               names_to = "resp_var",
               values_to = "resp_val"
               ) %>%
  
  # Pivotting longer for the explanatory variables  
  pivot_longer(cols = b:nli,
               names_to = "exp_var",
               values_to = "exp_val"
               ) %>%

  arrange(exp_var,resp_var) %>%

# Creating groups of resp_var and exp_var
  group_by(exp_var,resp_var) %>%
  nest() %>%
  
  # Applying linear model to each element
  mutate(lm = map(data,
    ~ lm(resp_val ~ exp_val,
         data = .x
         )
  )) %>%
  # Extracting R2 for each element  
  mutate(r2 = (map(lm,
                  ~summary(.x)$r.squared
                  ))
         )
  
nematode_mods$data[123]

summary(nematode_mods$lm[[1]])$r.squared


```
Above we used the `map()` function because we only had one iterating element (i.e., data).  

Now, let's unnest the r2 values, then only keep the largest r2 for each response variable, and make some plots.  

```{r}
nematode_mods_sel <- nematode_mods %>%
  unnest(r2) %>%
  group_by(resp_var) %>%
  slice_max(r2)


nematode_mods_sel
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
        
nematode_mods_sel_plots <- nematode_mods_sel %>%
  
  # Making scatterplots with r2 in subtitle
  mutate(splot = map2(data, r2,
                      ~ggplot(data = .x,
                               aes(x = exp_val,
                                   y = resp_val)
                               ) +
                        
                        geom_point() +
                        geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
                        labs(subtitle = paste("R2:", round(.y,3)))
  )) %>%

  # Making scatterplots with r2 in subtitle, and correct x and y axis titles  
  mutate(splot_better = pmap(list(.df = data,
                                  .r2 = r2,
                                  .rv = resp_var,
                                  .ev = exp_var),
                             
                             function(.df, .r2, .rv, .ev)
                               ggplot(data = .df,
                                      aes(x = exp_val,
                                          y = resp_val
                                          )
                                      ) + 
                               geom_point() +
                               geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
                               labs(subtitle = paste("R2:", 
                                                     round(.r2,3)),
                                    x = .ev,
                                    y = .rv
                                    
                                  
                                  )))
  
  
  
nematode_mods_sel_plots$splot_better[1]
```
Now, we had 2 iterating elements to create `splot`, so we needed to use `map2()`.  

Also, with more than 2 iterating elements to create `splot_better`, we used the function `pmap()` which accepts as many elements as needed.

Let's print the first plot:
```{r}

```

Now, let's print all of the plots  
```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(gridExtra)

allplots <- 
```

Finally, let's save all these plots as one figure.  
```{r}
library(gridExtra)

allplots 

allplots

marrangeGrob(nematode_mods_sel_plots$splot_better,
             ncol = 4, nrow = 4
             )

allplots

ggsave(plot = allplots,
       "../output/"
       )
```


# 7) Summary  
In this exercise, we:  
  - created two functions to simplify creating ndvi and cv  
  - iterated through the calculation of mean and cv using a `for` loop  
  - iterated through 150 sets of data to create 150 models using `map`  
  - selected best models, plotted (using `map2()` and `pmap()`), and exported to file
